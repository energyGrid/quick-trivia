# Project 1 Evaluation

## Deployment

**3: Excelling**
> The app is deployed to gh-pages

## Technical Requirements

**3: Excelling**
> App functions with minimal or no errors. You definitely pushed yourself on this, including timers. As an additional feature, I'd add scoring to show the number of right and wrong. 

## Code Quality

**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. Be sure to not leave code you're not using in the master branch of an application. Nice job writing comments to explain the functionality of your code.

Things you'd like specific feedback on:
Is there a better way to create a timer than using setInterval()?

> You pretty much would always have to use one of the built-in JS timing functions for a timer. Otherwise, you'd have to write your own timing function, which would be significantly more challenging. There could possibly be a plugin that handles what you need to with timers.



## Creativity and Interface

**3: Excelling**
> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. The design is really user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

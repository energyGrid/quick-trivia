Technologies used: html, css, javascript, jQuery, Google Fonts
Tested in Google Chrome v.58
Four documents included: index.html, style.css, script.js, README.md

I used CSS Grid to develop the styling and included nested grid items. The majority of the programming was done with jQuery while housing the majority of the html information in the script.js doc.

I started the project by building the javascript necessary to run the quiz. After, completing the programming I went back and used css to add styling.

Installation instructions: NONE

Unsolved problems:
-Users will get prompted "Incorrect" if they don't click next question button before hitting submit again.
-CSS styling grid within a grid problems not allowing items to stay centered.
-Need to expand the question field to allow for more dynamic questions, that don't seem bunched together.
-Would like to see a list of questions and answers at the end of the quiz.
